# Separating Controversy from Noise: Comparison and Normalization of Structural Polarization Measures
The data and scripts for "Separating Controversy from Noise: Comparison and Normalization of Structural Polarization Measures" -paper

## Data

The network_data contains two subfolders (single_hashtag_networks and multiple_hashtag_networks). All the networks are in .edgelist format.

## Scripts

*polarization_algorithms.py*: the implementations of all polarization measures analyzed in the paper

*partition_algorithms.py*: the different partition algorithms used for obtaining the two groups

*dk_analysis.py*: computing the polarization scores for randomized networks

*deghet_analysis.py*: the analysis of non-homogeneous degree sequences on polarization scores
